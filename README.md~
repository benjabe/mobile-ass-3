# User testing
Name: Martha Nigards√∏y Ekerhovd

## Observations during test
The user appeared to take the instruction to throw the phone literally. Humour is subjective after all.
She didn't really understand the purpose of the app.
She showed signs of confusion whilst using the application.
She complained that there was a lack of feedback in the app.
The appearance of negative numbers was confusing - this is kind of a bug anyway.

## Questions
**Did you feel confused by the app?** Yes.
**Did you understand how to use the app?** She understood that you were supposed to move the phone quickly in order to make something happen.
